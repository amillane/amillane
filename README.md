## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Drew Millaneâ€”welcome to my GitHub page! Here, you'll find a collection of projects I've worked on, from class assignments to my ongoing research with my advisor on spatial machine learning applications.

:computer: I'm also excited to share two new websites I've created: my [Portfolio](https://amillane.github.io/)  and my blog, [Data Trailblazing](https://amillane.github.io/DataTrailblazing/). These sites showcase my work and serve as platforms for learning and discovery.

:school: Currently, I'm a Master's student in Statistics at Brigham Young University, and I have to sayâ€”it's the coolest major out there! My studies have covered linear models, machine learning, and Bayesian statistics, and I'm on track to graduate in Spring 2025.

:slightly_smiling_face: Feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drewmillane) or email me at  [amillane99@outlook.com](mailto:amillane99@outlook.com).
